Gdd

gdd - a simple tool that uses zenity to lead a user through the dd clone process

Licensed under the terms of the WTFPL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL)

'gdd' works by promting the user for if and of disks then promts the user to accept the
'changes' that will be made to the disks. 

This program is made to assist users/technicians with the dd cloning process without 
having to install software such as Gdiskdump. This program will allow a technician to
boot to any Linux live cd with zenity support and run the script. 


Goals:

I would eventually like to be able to integrate a zenity progress bar that displays the progress
of the clone to the user.
